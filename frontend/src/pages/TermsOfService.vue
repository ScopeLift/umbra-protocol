    <p>
      Umbra is an application that utilizes the Ethereum blockchain network enabling users to send and receive payments
      on a website or mobile application that the user can interact with (the “App”). Using the App, users send and
      receive ETH and ERC20 tokens. ScopeLift ("ScopeLift", "we", or "us") is making the App/Platform available to you.
      Before you use the App/Platform or the Site, however, you will need to review these Terms of Use and any terms and
      conditions incorporated herein by reference (collectively, these “Terms").
    </p>

    <p>
      PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APP OR THE SITE. THESE TERMS GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE APP, THE
      SITE, AND ANY PURCHASES YOU MAKE, UNLESS WE HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT WITH YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE.
      WE ARE ONLY WILLING TO MAKE THE APP AND THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU IF YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS. BY USING THE
      APP AND/OR THE SITE, OR ANY PART OF EACH, YOU ARE CONFIRMING YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE
      TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE
      THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON THAT ENTITY’S BEHALF, IN WHICH CASE “YOU” WILL MEAN THAT ENTITY. IF
      YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE TERMS, THEN WE ARE UNWILLING TO MAKE THE APP
      OR THE SITE AVAILABLE TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR USE THE APP OR THE SITE.

      <li>
        The App must be used through a supported web browser on either a desktop or mobile device. Third party tools and

        in on the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        We neither own nor control the Ethereum network, or any other third-party site, product, or service that you
        might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the App. We will not
        be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may
        suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.

        transactions you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network. We will have no insight into
        or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. You
        agree we have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of
        any transactions that you engage in via the App or any other transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum or

      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="text-bold">7. Limitation of Liability</div>
    <ol>
      <li>
        YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE, OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO
        ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH YOU MAY INCUR,

        SUCH DAMAGES.
      </li>
      <li>
        YOU AGREE THAT OUR TOTAL, AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE
        TERMS OR YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) ANY PORTION OF THE APP, WHETHER IN

        UPON THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH HEREIN, WHICH REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR
        ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN US. WE WOULD NOT BE
        ABLE TO PROVIDE THE APP TO YOU WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.
      </li>
      <li>
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND SOME

      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="text-bold">8. Assumption of Risk</div>
    <p>You accept and acknowledge each of the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your Umbra-related transactions.
        ScopeLift is not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to your transactions on the App, the Site, or
        any blockchain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Usage of the App may result in funds becoming irrecoverable. ScopeLift has no control over the operation of the
        Ethereum network and cannot undo or reverse transactions that result in stuck funds.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of
        hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that
        third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and
        acknowledge that ScopeLift will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors,
        distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused.
      </li>
      <li>
        A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively
        impact the development of the Umbra App, and therefore the potential utility of the App.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum platform, a hard fork in the Ethereum platform, or a change in how
        transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum platform may have unintended, adverse effects on all applications
        using the Ethereum platform, including Umbra.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <div class="text-bold">9. Indemnification</div>
    <p>
      You agree to hold harmless and indemnify ScopeLift and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, employees,
      advertisers, licensors, suppliers or partners from and against any claim, liability, loss, damage (actual and
      consequential) of any kind or nature, suit, judgment, litigation cost, and attorneys’ fees arising out of or in
      any way related to (i) your breach of these Terms, (ii) your misuse of the App, (iii) your violation of applicable
      laws, rules or regulations in connection with your access to or use of the App, or (iv) your breach of our Privacy
      Policy. You agree that ScopeLift will have control of the defense or settlement of any such claims.
    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">10. External Sites</div>
    <p>
      The App may include hyperlinks to other web sites or resources (collectively, “External Sites”), which are
      provided solely as a convenience to our users. We have no control over any External Sites. You acknowledge and
      agree that we are not responsible for the availability of any External Sites, and that we do not endorse any
      advertising, products or other materials on or made available from any External Sites. Furthermore, you
      acknowledge and agree that we are not liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred as a result of the
      availability or unavailability of the External Sites, or as a result of any reliance placed by you upon the
      completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or made available from,
      any External Sites.
    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">11. Changes to the App</div>
    <p>
      We may revise and update these Terms of Use from time to time in our sole discretion. When we make changes, we
      will make the updated Terms available on the App and update the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these
      Terms accordingly, which apply to all access to and use of the App and Website thereafter. Please check these
      Terms periodically for changes. Any changes to the Terms will apply on the date that they are made, and your
      continued access to or use of the App after the Terms have been updated will constitute your binding acceptance of
      the updates. If you do not agree to any revised Terms, you may not access or use the App.
    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">12. Children</div>
    <p>
      You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the App is not intended for children under 13. IF YOU ARE 13 OR
      OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, OR THE LEGAL AGE OF MAJORITY WHERE YOU RESIDE IF THAT JURISDICTION HAS AN OLDER AGE
      OF MAJORITY, THEN YOU AGREE TO REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR
      PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU AGREE TO HAVE YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN REVIEW AND
      ACCEPT THESE TERMS ON YOUR BEHALF. IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR GUARDIAN AGREEING TO THE TERMS FOR THE BENEFIT OF A
      CHILD OVER 13, THEN YOU AGREE TO AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT CHILD’S USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING ALL
      FINANCIAL CHARGES AND LEGAL LIABILITY THAT HE OR SHE MAY INCUR.
    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">13. Privacy Policy</div>
    <p>
      Our Privacy Policy describes the ways we collect, use, store and disclose your personal information, and is hereby
      incorporated by this reference into these Terms. You agree to the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your

    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">14. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</div>
    <p>
      PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A
      LAWSUIT IN COURT.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF
      USE OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND US, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD,
      MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A
      NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY, AND YOU AGREE THAT SCOPELIFT AND YOU ARE EACH WAIVING
      THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BY A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN
      INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED AND YOU ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP THE
      ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
    </p>
    <p>
      The laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and applicable United States federal law, including the Federal
      Arbitration Action as specified herein, shall govern these Terms of Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for those disputes that shall be resolved in arbitration or in small claims court pursuant to this section,
      each party agrees to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the Commonwealth
      of Pennsylvania, USA provided that any claims or disputes shall be subject to the arbitration provisions set forth
      below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which may
      be brought, in an individual capacity only, and not on a class-wide or representative basis, in the courts
      specified above), any dispute between you and ScopeLift related in any way to, or arising in any way from, our
      Privacy Policy or these Terms of Services (“Dispute”) shall be finally settled on an individual,
      non-representative basis in binding arbitration in accordance with the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”)
      rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes (available from AAA on its website at www.adr.org), as modiﬁed
      by this Agreement or in accordance with rules on which we may mutually agree; provided, however, that to the
      extent a Dispute is within the scope of a small claims court’s jurisdiction, either you or ScopeLift may commence
      an action in small claims court, in the county (or equivalent) of your most recent physical address, to resolve
      the Dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any arbitration will be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator and shall take place in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania, USA. The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could award,
      including attorneys’ fees when authorized by law. The arbitral decision may be enforced in any court of competent
      jurisdiction. You hereby agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
      therefore, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) applies to these Terms of Service, including the agreement to
      arbitrate set forth above. We each agree that the FAA, and not state law, shall govern whether a Dispute is
      subject to arbitration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal
      appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or by us that an in-person hearing is
      appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties
      with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to
      agree on a location, such determination should be made by AAA or by the arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision will
      follow the terms of these Terms of Use and will be final and binding. The arbitrator will have authority to award
      temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief or relief providing for specific performance of these Terms of
      Use, but only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the individual claim before the arbitrator.
      The award rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
      Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, nothing in these Terms of Use will preclude you from bringing issues to the
      attention of federal, state, or local agencies and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.
    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">15. Waiver and Severability</div>
    <p>
      No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or
      continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the
      Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
      provision. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction
      to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the
      minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.
    </p>

    <div class="text-bold">16. Content Standards</div>
    <p>
      These content standards apply to any and all contributions and use by you to the App or Site. Your use and
      contributions must in their entirety comply with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws and
      regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, You must not:
