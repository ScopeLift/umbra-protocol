    <p class="text-bold">What information do we collect?</p>
    <p>
      When using our site, our cloud hosting providers may record the IP address that your request originated from. They
      also may retain server logs which include the IP address of every request to their servers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-bold">What do we use your information for?</p>
    <p>
      We do not use your information for any purpose beyond the default logging functionality provided by our cloud
      hosting providers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-bold">How do we protect your information?</p>
    <p>
      We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter,
      submit, or access your personal information.
    </p>

    <p class="text-bold">What is your data retention policy?</p>
    <p>We will make a good faith effort to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Retain server logs containing the IP address of all requests to this server no more than 90 days.</li>
      <li>Retain the IP addresses associated with registered users and their posts no more than 5 years.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the IP address logging requirement altogether, and destroy any existing logs, sometime in the future.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-bold">Do we use cookies?</p>
    <p>
      We do not use cookies. We do use local browser storage to store user preferences and settings between sessions.
      This data is never used to track users, and not sent anywhere beyond the user’s local device.

      you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information
      when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or
      others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to
      other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
