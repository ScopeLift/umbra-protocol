    "intro": "Introduction",
    "what-is-umbra": "What is Umbra?",
    "what-is-umbra-answer": "<p>Umbra is a stealth address protocol for Ethereum. That means it allows a payer to send funds to a fresh address. That address is controlled by the intended receiver, but only the payer and the receiver know that. </p><p> One way to think of Umbra is this: Imagine if, before anyone sent you funds, you sent them a brand new,never before used address. Only the sender would know you control that address, which adds a layer of privacy to your payment. Payments via Umbra work similarly, but are non-interactive—you don’t need to give someone a fresh address, they can just generate one they know only you will be able to access.</p>",
    "an-example": "Can you walk me through an example?",
    "an-example-answer": "<p>Alice owns a business and hires Bob to subcontract for her. She agrees to pay Bob 1,000 Dai/week for his work. Bob owns the ENS address <span class=\"code\">bob.eth</span>. If Alice sent the funds each week to <span class=\"code\">bob.eth</span>, anyone looking at the chain could trivially know that Alice is paying Bob 1,000 Dai each week.</p><p>Instead, Bob and Alice will use Umbra for private payments. The first time Bob visits the Umbra app, he sets up his account, enabling anyone to privately pay him using his address. Alice then uses Umbra to send 1,000 Dai to Bob each week— she only needs to know his address or ENS name.</p><p>On chain, we see Alice pays 1,000 Dai to a new empty address each week. Behind the scenes, Bob controls the keys to each of these addresses via Umbra, but nobody except Alice and Bob knows this.</p><p>Bob uses Umbra to withdraw his 1,000 Dai each week. He only needs to provide an address to send it to. It’s best for him to use an address that’s not tied to his identity. He usually chooses to send it straight to an exchange, where he sells it for fiat as needed. Importantly, this means <strong>Bob's exchange now knows this payment went to him</strong>. To the casual chain observer— one without access to proprietary centralized exchange data— the fact that Alice's payment went to Bob is obscured.</p><p> Consider another example: Liza runs a website that asks for donations. If everyone donated by directly sending her funds, everyone would know how much Liza received in donations. If donations were sent with Umbra instead, each donation would be sent to a different address, and only Liza would know the total amount of donations she received.</p>",
    "wen-token": "Does Umbra have a token?",
    "wen-token-answer": "No.",
    "how-does-it-work": "How does it work?",
    "how-does-it-work-answer": "<p>Below is a high level description of how Umbra works:</p><ol><li>When setting up your Umbra account, users sign a message. The hash of this message is used to generate two private keys—a \"spending key\" and a \"viewing key\". </li> <li>The corresponding public keys are both published on-chain as records associated with your address.</li><li>A payer uses your address or ENS name to look up your two public keys. Separately, the payer generates a random number.</li><li>The random number is used with the spending public key to generate a \"stealth address\" to send funds to. The same random number is used with the viewing public key to encrypt the random number.</li><li> Using the Umbra contract, the payer sends funds to the stealth address and the encrypted data is emitted as an <span class=\"code\">Announcement</span> event.</li><li>The receiver scans all <span class=\"code\">Announcement</span> events from the Umbra contract. For each, they use their viewing private key to decrypt the random number, then multiply that number by their spending private key to generate the stealth private key. If the stealth private key controls the address funds were sent to, this payment was for the receiver </li> <li> The receiver can now use the private key to either directly send the transaction required to withdraw funds to another address, or sign a meta-transaction to have the withdrawal request processed by a relayer.</li></ol>",

    "how-does-it-work-technical-details": "Technical Details: How does it work?",
    "how-private": "How private is Umbra?",
    "how-private-answer": "<p>Umbra offers a limited set of privacy guarantees and it’s important to understand them before using the protocol. Umbra does <span class=\"text-bold\">not</span> offer \"full\" privacy like Aztec or Zcash. It simply makes it impossible for any outside observers (i.e. anyone who is not the sender or the receiver) to know who the sender paid by looking at the receiving address.</p><p>It’s important to understand that poor hygiene by the receiver— for example, sending the funds directly to a publicly known address— eliminates the privacy benefits for both the sender and receiver.</p><p>The privacy properties of Umbra can also be diminished if an observer can narrow down the set of potential recipients for a given a transaction. Any valid public key can be used as a recipient, and anyone who has sent a transaction on Ethereum has a publicly available public key. Therefore, by default, the \"anonymity set\"—the set of potential recipients of a transaction—is anyone who has ever sent an Ethereum transaction!</p><p>In practice this isn’t necessarily the case, and an observer may be able to narrow down the list of recipients in a few ways:</p><ol><li>Most users will use the Umbra stealth key registry to send funds, so the recipient most likely has keys published there.</li><li>Poor hygiene when withdrawing funds from your stealth addresses can reduce or entirely remove the privacy properties provided by Umbra. See the \"What address are safe for withdrawing funds to?\" for more details. Always use caution when withdrawing!</li></ol>",
    "umbra-vs-mixer": "Is Umbra a mixer?",
    "umbra-vs-mixer-answer": "<p> No. Umbra is not a mixer and does not use zero knowledge proofs. Instead, Umbra is based on ordinary elliptic curve cryptography. It’s meant for payments between two entities, and comes with a different set of privacy tradeoffs. Rather than breaking the link between sending and receiving address, like a mixer, Umbra makes that link meaningless. Everyone can see who sent the funds, and everyone can see the address funds were sent to, but that receiving address has never been seen on-chain so it’s impossible for any outside observers to know who controls it. </p>",
    "account-setup": "Account Setup",
    "what-is-setup": "What is account setup?",
    "what-is-setup-answer": " <p> A User signs a message, and from that Umbra public keys and private keys are generated. A transaction is made on the Umbra stealth key registry, associating the public keys with your address. </p>",
    "is-setup-required": "Is account setup required?",
    "is-setup-required-answer": " <p> This step is not technically required, but is strongly recommended for security reasons. In order to access stealth funds, the Umbra app needs your private keys. Inputting your wallet’s private keys into any website is very dangerous, and we don’t want you do to that! By going through the account setup process, you sign a message to generate an app-specific set of Umbra private keys. This is much more secure, as Umbra never has your wallet’s private key. </p>",
    "why-setup-again": "Why do I need to setup my account again?",
    "why-setup-again-answer": "<p> If you configured your Umbra account while the service was still in Beta&mdash;before October 2021&mdash;you need to redo setup. This requires one signature and one transaction. </p> <p> This additional setup step is due to an upgrade to Umbra's stealth key registry system. The old system relied on records placed on the ENS resolver associated with a user's address. The new system is much simpler, and uses a simple mapping between the user's address and their stealth keys. </p> <p> The new system was developed in response to user feedback during Umbra's Beta period. The old system required multiple transactions, and also required senders to use the receiver's ENS name, which caused confusion. The new system requires only a single transaction, and senders can provide either the receiver's ENS name or their regular Ethereum address. Overall, the new system is simpler to both configure and use. </p>",

    "why-setup-again-answer-this-issue": "this issue",
    "sending-funds": "Sending Funds",
    "why-only-tokens": "Why are only certain tokens available?",
    "why-only-tokens-answer": "<p> When you send ETH, the ETH is sent directly to the computed stealth address. That stealth address now has ETH, which is required to pay gas, so the receiver can easily transfer that ETH with an ordinary send. </p> <p> When you send tokens, the tokens are not sent directly to the computed stealth address. If they were, you’d first need to get ETH into the stealth address in order to pay for the gas to withdraw funds (or use some costly CREATE2 schemes). Instead, the tokens are held by the contract and can be released in one of two ways: </p> <ol> <li>The stealth address directly calls the <span class=\"code\">withdrawToken()</span> method</li> <li> Anyone calls <span class=\"code\">withdrawTokenOnBehalf()</span> and passes in a signature from the stealth address. This enables meta-transactions to be used with the relayer of your choice. </li> </ol> <p> By default, the Umbra app uses a relayer from the Umbra team. Managing relayers and making sure you are properly reimbursed for gas fees can be tricky, so to start only a few tokens are enabled and the list of supported tokens will be expanded. </p>",
    "when-receive": "When will the recipient receive their funds?",
    "when-receive-answer": "<p> Immediately! The recipient receives and can withdraw funds immediately after the send transaction is mined. </p>",
    "min-amount": "Why is there a minimum send amount?",
    "min-amount-answer": " <p> When you send funds with Umbra, the recipient address is an address that has never been used before. This means it has no ETH and no tokens, so it must pay for withdrawals using the funds that were sent to it. When sending ETH, this is done with a regular transfer. When sending tokens, this is done with a relayer so fees can be paid with the received tokens. Therefore, there is a minimum send amount to ensure the recipient can always withdraw their funds easily. </p>",
    "umbra-fee": "Why is there sometimes an Umbra fee?",
    "umbra-fee-answer": "<p> Finding funds you've received through Umbra requires scanning through all sent transactions, then checking each to find which ones are for you. </p> <p> On networks with very cheap transaction fees, the Umbra contract charges a small <span class=\"code\">toll</span> when sending funds to deter spam transactions, as spam would make it more difficult to scan through all sent transactions. </p>",
    "payment-links": "What are the payment links?",
    "payment-links-answer": " <p> When on the Send page, fill out some or all of the Send form and click the <span class=\"text-italic\">Copy payment link</span> button. This will copy a URL to your clipboard that, when visited, pre-populates the send form with the values in the URL. </p> <p> Be careful when specifying an amount as part of your payment link, as it can reduce privacy. For example, if you share a payment link so people can donate 100 DAI to you, and suddenly lots of 100 DAI sends start going through Umbra, observers will know that it's very likely those transfers are to you. </p>",
    "send-history-different-devices": "Why can't I see my send history on different devices?",
    "send-history-different-devices-answer": "<p>On chain, the recipient of your sending transactions is not discernable. This is by design, and it is the point of Umbra—the receiving address is a stealth address. As a result, it's not possible to sync your send history across devices by observing on chain history.</p><p>Instead, your send history is encrypted and stored in your browser's local storage. It never leaves your device, and can't be seen on other devices as a result. Furthermore, transactions sent before this feature was added to the Umbra app in May 2023 are not stored on any device.</p>",
    "receiving-funds": "Receiving Funds",
    "safe-address": "What addresses are safe for withdrawing funds to?",
    "safe-address-answer": "<p> We suggest 3 ways of withdrawing in a privacy-preserving way. Note that each comes with its own set of tradeoffs. </p> <ol> <li> Withdraw to an address that is not publicly associated with your identity (tradeoff: the sender will now be able to infer you control that address) </li> <li> Generate a new address and withdraw into that (tradeoff: if you’ve received tokens, you’ll have to fund that address with ETH for gas before you can use them) </li> <li> Withdraw to an exchange address (tradeoff: if you withdraw to Coinbase, then Coinbase will know who sent you funds) </li> </ol>",
    "non-safe-address": "What addresses are NOT safe for withdrawing funds to?",
    "non-safe-address-answer": "<p> The risk to consider when withdrawing is that if you withdraw to an address that is associated with some publicly known identity, then privacy is lost as follows: </p> <p> Let’s say Alice sends funds to Bob via Umbra. Right now, only Alice and Bob know that Alice paid Bob. Any other observers know Alice sent funds to someone, but they don’t know who that someone is. </p> <p> If Bob withdraws those funds to his publicly known <span class=\"code\">bob.eth</span> address, which resolves to <span class=\"code\">0x123...def</span>, then observers know one of two things happened: </p> <ol> <li>Scenario 1: Alice sent funds to Bob, then Bob withdrew them to his own address, OR</li> <li>Scenario 2: Alice sent funds to someone that knows Bob, and paid Bob from their stealth address</li> </ol> <p> Additionally, consider the case where Bob withdraws by directly paying his friend Charlie—Charlie now knows that Alice paid Bob. </p> <p> To help mitigate this, the Umbra app will try to warn you if you enter a withdrawal address that might reduce your privacy. Therefore you’ll see warnings if the app detects you are withdrawing to an address that: </p> <ol> <li>Has an ENS or CNS name</li> <li>Owns POAP tokens</li> <li>Is the wallet you are logged in with</li> <li>(Coming soon): Withdrawing to an address that has contributed to Gitcoin.</li> </ol> <p> This is <span class=\"text-bold\">not</span> a comprehensive list of potentially dangerous withdrawal addresses, so use caution. </p>",
    "umbra-withdrawal": "Can Umbra make it easier to withdraw funds in a privacy preserving way?",
    "umbra-withdrawal-answer": "<p> Yes! This is an area where we intend to make many improvements in the future, mostly by relying on Umbra’s post-withdrawal hook functionality. </p> <p>Some examples of how we plan to leverage this include:</p> <ol><li>Atomically swap some tokens to ETH and send all of it to a fresh address</li> <li>Withdraw funds straight into DeFi protocols</li> </ol> <p> There are many other options which we can pursue via hooks to greatly expand the privacy preserving withdrawal options. </p>",
    "scan-time": "Why does it take so long to scan for my funds?",
    "scan-time-answer": "<p> To find payments sent to you, the app needs to search through every payment that was sent and check if it was for you. So the more payments that have been sent, the longer this will take. </p>",
    "scan-time-answer-issue": "This is an open research problem with various potential solutions ({one}{two}), and we hope to improve this over time.",

    "crypto-js": "Is cryptography in JavaScript secure?",
    "crypto-js-answer": "In general, a JavaScript execution environment is not ideal for meeting security requirements. It presents challenges in hiding secret data in memory (e.g. your app-specific private keys) and preventing that data from being written to disk. Using JavaScript also means the underlying cryptography library may be susceptible to things like {timingAttacks}.

    "how-it-works": "How does it work?",
    "how-it-works-answer": "<p class=\"text-bold\">Stealth Address Overview</p> <p>Let’s start with how the Umbra protocol (and more generally, how stealth addresses) work:</p> <p> The recipient has public key <span class=\"code\">P</span> and private key <span class=\"code\">p</span>. The sender generates a random number <span class=\"code\">r</span>, and computes a stealth public key as <span class=\"code\">P_stealth = P * r</span> using elliptic curve multiplication. The sender derives the Ethereum address <span class=\"code\">a_stealth</span> from that public key, and sends funds to it. Thanks to the magic of elliptic curve math, the recipient can generate the private key <span class=\"code\">p_stealth</span> needed to access funds at <span class=\"code\">a_stealth</span> by computing <span class=\"code\">p_stealth = p * r</span>. </p> <p> The first problem to solve is how does the sender get the value <span class=\"code\">r</span> to the receiver? If <span class=\"code\">r</span> was publicly known, observers could determine who funds were sent to by computing <span class=\"code\">P * r</span> for various published <span class=\"code\">P</span> values until the find the stealth address. So <span class=\"code\">r</span> needs to be encrypted. </p>",
    "how-it-works-answer-ECDH": "Encryption is done with {ECDH} (ECDH), meaning the sender uses the recipient’s public key to encrypt the random number. The encrypted random number gives us the cipertext {c}. The encrypted random number {c} and stealth address {aStealth} are emitted as an {announcement} event from the Umbra contract. ECDH requires the sender to generate an ephemeral private key for encryption, so the ephemeral public key {PEphemeral} that the receiver will need to decrypt is also emitted in this event.",

Because every single <span class=\"code\">Announcement</span> needs to be scanned, it can take a long time to find your finds. </p> <p> One way to speed this up (from the user's perspective) is to delegate scanning to a third-party service and have them notify you when you receive funds. But the scanning service needs your private key <span class=\"code\">p</span> to determine if you received funds, and if they have <span class=\"code\">p</span> they can steal your funds! </p> <p> We can solve this by instead generating two application-specific private keys. One private key will be the viewing private key, <span class=\"code\">p_view</span>, used for encrypting the random number. The other will be the spending private key, <span class=\"code\">p_spend</span>, used for computing the stealth address and accessing those funds. Therefore, our send and receive flow is now modified a bit to: </p> <ol> <li> Recipient has two private keys, <span class=\"code\">p_spend</span> and <span class=\"code\">p_view</span>, and publishes the corresponding public keys <span class=\"code\">P_spend</span> and <span class=\"code\">P_view</span>. </li> <li> The sender generates a random number <span class=\"code\">r</span> and encrypts it using <span class=\"code\">P_view</span> and an ephemeral private key <span class=\"code\">p_ephemeral</span> to generate a ciphertext <span class=\"code\">c</span> </li> <li> The sender computes the stealth address as the address derived from <span class=\"code\">P_stealth = P_spend * r</span> and sends funds to that address </li> <li> The Umbra contract emits <span class=\"code\">c</span>, <span class=\"code\">P_ephemeral</span>, and stealth address <span class=\"code\">a_stealth</span> </li> <li> For each event, the receiver uses <span class=\"code\">p_view</span> and <span class=\"code\">P_ephemeral</span> to decrypt <span class=\"code\">r</span>, then checks if <span class=\"code\">p_stealth = p_spend * r</span> is the private key that controls a_stealth </li> </ol> <p> With this approach, the recipient can provide a third-party scanning service with <span class=\"code\">p_view</span> and <span class=\"code\">P_spend</span>.
